# Progress

## Implemented Features
- ✅ Basic MCP server structure and protocol implementation
- ✅ `analyze_image` tool for URL-based image analysis
- ✅ `analyze_image_from_path` tool for local file-based image analysis
- ✅ Image validation (URL accessibility, file existence, MIME type)
- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- ✅ Error handling for various failure cases
- ✅ Basic security measures for file path handling
- ✅ Documentation for installation and usage
- ✅ Docker support
- ✅ Smithery package configuration
- ✅ Permanent caching system for analyzed images (both URLs and file paths)
- ✅ Global cache storage in user's home directory for cross-project persistence

## Partially Implemented Features
- ⚠️ Comprehensive error logging (basic implementation, but could be improved)
- ⚠️ Cross-platform file path handling (works but needs more testing)
- ⚠️ Manual cache invalidation (no mechanism to clear specific cache entries)
- ⚠️ Home directory permission handling (may vary across different environments)

## Planned Features
- 📋 Support for customizable analysis prompts
- 📋 Batch processing functionality
- 📋 Support for additional AI models
- 📋 Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- 📋 Advanced security features
- 📋 Cache management utilities (for viewing and cleaning the cache in user's home)

## Known Issues
1. Type errors during build for `mime-types` module (doesn't affect functionality)
2. Limited path validation may not cover all edge cases across different operating systems
3. No retry mechanism for OpenAI API failures
4. Cache size is not limited and continues to grow, which could lead to storage issues for long-running servers
5. No way to detect if an image at a cached URL or path has changed and requires reanalysis
6. May encounter permission issues when writing to user's home directory in certain environments (e.g., Docker containers with restricted permissions)

## Project Status
The project is in a functional state and can be used in production environments. Both core tools (`analyze_image` and `analyze_image_from_path`) are working correctly. The permanent caching system significantly improves performance and reduces API costs for repeated analysis of the same images, based on the assumption that image content at specific URLs or paths rarely changes. Cache is now stored in the user's home directory for better persistence across multiple runs and project instances.

## Testing Status
- ✅ Basic functionality tested
- ⚠️ Limited cross-platform testing
- ⚠️ Limited cache system testing
- ⚠️ Limited testing of home directory storage across environments
- ❌ No automated tests implemented yet

## Documentation Status
- ✅ README with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ Configuration examples for different clients
- ✅ Information about caching functionality
- ⚠️ Limited examples and advanced usage scenarios
- ⚠️ No documentation on cache management
- ⚠️ No documentation on cache location and structure
