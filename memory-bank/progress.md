# Progress

## Implemented Features
- ✅ Basic MCP server structure and protocol implementation
- ✅ `analyze_image` tool for URL-based image analysis
- ✅ `analyze_image_from_path` tool for local file-based image analysis
- ✅ Image validation (URL accessibility, file existence, MIME type)
- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- ✅ Error handling for various failure cases
- ✅ Basic security measures for file path handling
- ✅ Documentation for installation and usage
- ✅ Docker support
- ✅ Smithery package configuration

## Partially Implemented Features
- ⚠️ Comprehensive error logging (basic implementation, but could be improved)
- ⚠️ Cross-platform file path handling (works but needs more testing)

## Planned Features
- 📋 Support for customizable analysis prompts
- 📋 Caching mechanism for previously analyzed images
- 📋 Batch processing functionality
- 📋 Support for additional AI models
- 📋 Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- 📋 Advanced security features

## Known Issues
1. Type errors during build for `mime-types` module (doesn't affect functionality)
2. Limited path validation may not cover all edge cases across different operating systems
3. No retry mechanism for OpenAI API failures

## Project Status
The project is in a functional state and can be used in production environments, but there are opportunities for enhancement and expansion. Both core tools (`analyze_image` and `analyze_image_from_path`) are working correctly.

## Testing Status
- ✅ Basic functionality tested
- ⚠️ Limited cross-platform testing
- ❌ No automated tests implemented yet

## Documentation Status
- ✅ README with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ Configuration examples for different clients
- ⚠️ Limited examples and advanced usage scenarios
