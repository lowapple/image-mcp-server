# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in an operational state with two main functionalities:
1. Analyzing images from URLs via the `analyze_image` tool
2. Analyzing images from local file paths via the `analyze_image_from_path` tool

Both tools leverage OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for high-quality image analysis.

## Recent Changes
- Added support for local file path analysis with the `analyze_image_from_path` tool
- Implemented security measures for safe file path handling
- Added MIME type detection to ensure only image files are processed
- Updated documentation to clarify usage for both URL and local file analysis

## Current Decisions
- Using GPT-4o-mini as the image analysis model due to its balance of capability and cost
- Implementing strict validation for both URLs and file paths to ensure security
- Supporting deployment through multiple methods (direct, Smithery, Docker)

## Next Steps
Potential enhancements to consider:
1. Adding support for more comprehensive image analysis options (like focused prompts)
2. Implementing caching to reduce API calls for previously analyzed images
3. Adding support for batch processing of multiple images
4. Exploring additional models beyond GPT-4o-mini
5. Adding more detailed error reporting and logging
6. Creating additional examples and usage documentation

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring secure handling of local file paths across different operating systems
- Balancing the detail of image analysis with token usage and costs
- Providing clear guidance for AI assistants when specifying file paths
