# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in an operational state with two main functionalities:
1. Analyzing images from URLs via the `analyze_image` tool
2. Analyzing images from local file paths via the `analyze_image_from_path` tool

Both tools leverage OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for high-quality image analysis and now feature permanent caching capabilities to reduce redundant API calls, based on the assumption that image content at the same URL or path rarely changes.

## Recent Changes
- Changed cache storage location to user's home directory under `image-analysis` folder for better persistence and access across projects
- Removed cache TTL (Time To Live) to implement permanent caching
- Implemented caching system using lowdb to store analysis results for both URLs and file paths
- Created secure hash-based cache keys for both URL and path inputs
- Persisted cache data to a JSON file for persistence between server restarts
- Added support for local file path analysis with the `analyze_image_from_path` tool
- Implemented security measures for safe file path handling
- Added MIME type detection to ensure only image files are processed
- Updated documentation to clarify usage for both URL and local file analysis

## Current Decisions
- Using GPT-4o-mini as the image analysis model due to its balance of capability and cost
- Implementing strict validation for both URLs and file paths to ensure security
- Supporting deployment through multiple methods (direct, Smithery, Docker)
- Using lowdb for caching due to its simplicity and file-based persistence
- Implementing permanent caching with no expiration for analysis results
- Storing cache in user's home directory for easier access and persistence

## Next Steps
Potential enhancements to consider:
1. Adding support for more comprehensive image analysis options (like focused prompts)
2. Adding manual cache invalidation mechanism (since TTL was removed)
3. Adding support for batch processing of multiple images
4. Exploring additional models beyond GPT-4o-mini
5. Adding more detailed error reporting and logging
6. Creating additional examples and usage documentation
7. Creating cache management utility to view/clean cache from user home directory

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring secure handling of local file paths across different operating systems
- Balancing the detail of image analysis with token usage and costs
- Providing clear guidance for AI assistants when specifying file paths
- Managing cache size for deployments with limited storage (especially important with permanent caching)
- Implementing mechanism to detect actual changes in image content at same URL/path
- Ensuring appropriate permissions for writing to the user's home directory in various environments
